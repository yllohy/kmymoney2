<h2 class="highlighted">General.</h2>

<p>Each file should contain only one declaration or implementation and the
filename should reflect the class name.  e.g ksomethingdlg.h would contain
a declaration for the KSomethingDlg class.</p>

<p>A tab width of 2 spaces should be used and if your editor supports it, the
tabs should be changed into spaces.   (KDevelop/KWrite supports tab
translation).</p>

<p>All dialogs should be located in the kmymoney2/dialogs directory.</p>

<p>Each class should be as self contained as possible.  If for instance, you are
creating a dialog, then all the signals and slots should be connected within that
dialog class.  Where access is needed to the class details methods should be
used.  This enhances readability and makes maintenance a lot easier with each
object having it's own state, indentity and behaviour, (see Object Oriented
Analysis & Design using UML, Bennet & Co).</p>
