<h2 class="highlighted">Brief overview.</h2>

<p>KMyMoney2 as it stands is logically split into two separate functions.  The
'engine' and the GUI.</p>

<p>The engine provides classes and methods to manipulate the data needed by
KMyMoney2 and will be GUI independant.  This means that programs will be able
to access KMyMoney2 files by using a standard library which would affect which
eventual GUI was implemented, be it a console application, Gnome application or,
as in KMyMoney2's case, a KDE application.</p>

<p>The GUI for KMyMoney2 is currently built for the KDE desktop environment and
uses many of the great features KDE provides.</p>
