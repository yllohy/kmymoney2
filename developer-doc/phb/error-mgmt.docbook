<title>Problem Management</title>
<para>
This chapter is a first draft. It contains some ideas that have to be 
validated by the developer community.
</para>

<sect1 id="problem-reporting">
<title>Reporting problems</title>
<para>
Problems (that covers errors, enhancement request, etc.) concerning the
&app; project are maintained
using the SourceForge.net platform. This is the sole location, where
problems have to be reported. The source for such a problem report can be
one of the developers or any other user of &app;.
</para>

<sect2 id="problem-reference">
<title>Referencing problems</title>
<para>
Once added to the database, the problem will be assigned a unique problem
number. This number must be mentioned whenever the problem is referenced
(e.g. in the subject of a mail to the developer mailing-list, a checkin
comment or an entry in the ChangeLog file). To allow searches for the number,
a specific format has to be used for these references.

The format is
<command>#<emphasis>assigned-number</emphasis></command>, e.g. #481229.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>


<sect1 id="problem-attributes">
<title>Problem attributes</title>
<para>
Besides the fixed problem number which is created when the report is filed,
 each
problem has a couple of attributes that might change during the
life-cycle of the problem. They will be described in the following
chapters.
</para>

<sect2 id="problem-reported-by">
<title>Reported By</title>
<para>
As the problem number, this field is fix. It represents the SourceForge
username of the individual who filed the report.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="problem-severity-level">
<title>Severity level</title>
<para>
The SourceForge.net platform allows to assign a severity level to each
problem. It ranges from 1 to 10. The meaning in our project and the
consequences are defined as follows:

<sect2 id="problem-assignee">
<title>Assignee</title>
<para>
This field represents the SourceForge.net username of the individual
working on the problem. Each developer should pick problems he feels
competent to work on. The possibility to assign another developer to a
problem should be used only to gather a comment from this developer. This
should be clearly marked as comment with the report.
</para>

<note>
<para>
The number of unassigned problem reports should be 0 most of the time to
give clear signal to the world that the developers are working on the
project!
</para>
</note>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="problem-status">
<title>Status</title>
<para>
Each problem has a status. Right after filing a report, it will be assigned
the status 'open' automatically by the SourceForge.net platform. Whenever a
developer is working on the problem, he will have to modifiy the value of
this field to reflect the current status. The following values are
available and have the associated meaning:
