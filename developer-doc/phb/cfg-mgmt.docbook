<chapter id="cfg-mgmt">
<title>Configuration Management</title>
<para>
Whenever a project is developed in stages, it is very important for the
people working on the project to know, which version of the project is used
by the users and how it was built and what the components of this project
are. This applies to hardware (e.g. automobiles) as well as software.
Think of the times, when a car manufacturer calls certain cars to be
repaired due to production problems. The manufacturer
can track down the relevant cars because he is using a
configuration management system and knows each car that contains e.g.
faulty parts.
</para>

<para>
The same applies to software development projects: whenever a version (stage of
development) of the project is made
public, it has to be given a distinct name or tag - usually the version number -
and the development team must keep a snapshot of all components that made
up that stage of the software project. This does not only include the
source code of the project, but all libraries in their relevant stage as
well as compilers and tools and all their installation/configuration
information.  If all this information is present, the software development
team is capable to exactly reproduce each delivered version to search for
problems occuring with this version. If this capability is not available,
the development team has a hard time to find these problems.
</para>

<para>
CVS helps us in our project to cover one aspect of configuration
management: version control of the source code. It helps us to keep the
snapshots of all the files the project team is responsible for in a
central repository. Another aspect of CVS is concurrent development which
allows us that some of us can develop
new features of the project while others fix problems with previous
versions even if both tasks modify the same source file. This feature is
called branching. How branches will be organized in our project is
explained in the chapter about 
<link linkend="version-mgmt">Version management</link>.
</para>

<para>
The configuration management also regulates how the development team passes
information among the members. This includes things like naming
conventions, how errors are reported, rated and fixed and who is
responsible for which task. The emphasis on this document though is the
management of the version control system and how things are handled in this
area. This does not mean, that the other important issues of configuration
management are left outside. They are just not in the focus of this
document.
</para>

<para>
Throughout this document a few terms are used. In order to avoid confusion
because these terms might be used differently in other documents, they are
defined here.

<entry>Definition</entry>
</row>
</thead>

<tbody>
<row>
<entry>Revision</entry>
<entry>
A <emphasis>revision</emphasis> is the stage of a single file in the
repository. <emphasis>Revisions</emphasis> start with the value 1.1 upon
the initial check-in and are incremented with each check-in of that file.
After the third check-in, the <emphasis>revision</emphasis> of a file has
the numeric value of 1.3.

Once branches are made, <emphasis>revisions</emphasis> can have values like
1.6.2.2.  Since the <emphasis>revisions</emphasis> differ for all files,
the revision number is only necessary for certain administrative tasks on 
single files (e.g.
<link linkend="promoting-changes">merging data from another branch</link>).
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>Tag, Label</entry>
<entry>
A <emphasis>tag</emphasis> is a string that represents a single revision of
a file. Multiple tags can point to the same revision of a file.
Sometimes, <emphasis>label</emphasis> is used as a synonym for tag.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>Version</entry>
<entry>
A <emphasis>version</emphasis> is the stage of the whole project in the
repository. As already mentioned, the revisions for the files contained in
the project differ from each other for a specific
<emphasis>version</emphasis>. Therefor, each revision contained in a
<emphasis>version</emphasis> receives the same tag.
This tag can be used
to checkout an exact copy of the version of the project.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>Repository</entry>
<entry>
The repository is the central database containing all revisions of all
files of the &app; project. It is located on the SourceForge.net and can
be accessed via &cvs;.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>Sandbox</entry>
<entry>
The sandbox is the local work area for the developer. Initially, a sandbox
is filled by checking out a specific stage of the repository. Changes made
to the sandbox are moved to the repository by the checkin process. Changes
made by other developers are transferred to one's own sandbox by the update
process.  

A developer can maintain different sandboxes of the same project in
different directories on the same machine. This requires thorough attention
of the developer which sandbox he is modifying. Using several sandboxes is
usually meaningful if a developer works on changes on a release branch
(stable release) and on the main-branch (development release) at the same
time. See <link linkend="multiple-branches">the appendix</link> for an
example.

<!-- SECTION =================================================== -->
<sect1 id="vc-tool">
<title>Version Control Tool</title>
<para>
Since the &app; project is hosted on the <ulink
url="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</ulink> platform, <ulink
url="http://www.cvshome.org">CVS</ulink> is used as the version control
tool. &cvs; is widely accepted as version control tool in the open source
community and covers our needs pretty well.
</para>
<para>
The &app; project's central repository is handled on the
SourceForge platform. Developers do not edit files directly in the
repository, but rather checkout a working copy into their local
sandbox. This local sandbox can then be modified without the necessity of
a direct link to the central repository.
Once the developer is confident with the changes made, he checks the files
back into repository.
</para>

<para>
During the checkin process, &cvs; keeps track of all the changes made. This
allows to review a complete history of all modifications ever made to the
project.
As mentioned above, it is very important in certain circumstances to have
such a history.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="repo-access">
<title>Access to the repository</title>
<para>
Access to the repository is available in two different forms
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Read-Only access</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Read-Write access</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Read-Only access</title>
<para>
Read-Only access is granted to anybody anonymously to the repository. For
this type of access you do not need a user account on the SourceForge
platform. Access is made through the <emphasis>pserver</emphasis>-protocol
of &cvs;: See <ulink
url="http://sourceforge.net/">the description on SourceForge</ulink> for more details.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Read-Write access</title>
<para>
In order to get read-write access to the repository, two things are
necessary. First you need a user account on the SourceForge platform.
Second you need to qualifiy as a developer with the &app; project
administrator(s). Once they have added you to the list of developers, you
can access the repository through an <emphasis>SSH</emphasis> encrypted
tunnel.

See <ulink
url="http://sourceforge.net/">the description on SourceForge</ulink> for more details.

<sect1 id="version-controlled-files">
<title>Version controlled files</title>
<para>
This chapter explains which files have to be version controlled. It also
explains how to configure &cvs; to skip certain files that are generated by
the compile/build process but should not be stored in the repository.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Files that must be stored in the repository</title>
<para>
All files that form an application (e.g. source code, header files, icons,
documentation, etc.) that are necessary to compile, build and run the
application <command>must</command> be checked into the central repository.
</para>

<caution>
<para>
Before you add a file to the repository you must check it's format. If it's
a binary format the special option <command>-kb</command> must be appended
to the <command>cvs add</command> in order to inform the central repository
to leave the file as it is
</para>
</caution>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Files that should not be stored in the repository</title>

<para>
All files that are automatically generated by the build process (e.g.
object files, libraries, executables, Makefiles, etc.) should not be checked
into the repository because they can easily be reconstructed by the
developer. In very rare circumstances it might be necessary to checkin an
automatically generated file. This is always an exception.

<note>
<para>
I mentioned Makefiles above because I assume that &ac; and &am; are used.
Using &ac; and &am; supplies the project with a
<command>configure</command> script that creates the Makefiles. The
necessary input files are called <command>Makefile.am</command> that must
be checked into the repository as source to the Makefiles. 
</para>
<para>
If you do not use &ac; and &am; and write your Makefiles directly, they
have to be checked in as they are not automatically generated. Nevertheless,
using non &am; generated Makefiles should be avoided.
</para>

<sect1 id="version-mgmt">
<title>Version management</title>
<para>
At certain times to be defined by the project's administrators (actually
configuration manager) a snapshot is taken from the repository. In order to
fix the stage of this snapshot in the repository, a
<emphasis>tag</emphasis> is placed on this stage. Tagging the repository
creates a version of the project.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Layout of the version numbers</title>
<para>
The version number is made out of three numeric fields. These are:

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The major release number</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The minor release number</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The micro release number</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

In order to serve as a tag for &cvs;, the text <command>rel-</command> is
prepended to the version numbers and the three fields are seperated with a
dash (e.g. rel-0-3-7).
</para>

<para>
The major release number will be changed when all the proposed features
mentioned in the release plan (available on the 
<ulink url="http://kmymoney2.sourceforge.net/">project web-site</ulink>)
are designedi, coded and tested.
</para>

<para>
One of the objectives of the minor release number is to differentiate
between stable and unstable versions of the project. As a widely accepted
procedure, odd numbers are used for development versions, even numbers
identify stable versions. Whenever the configuration manager decides that
to create a new stable release, this will also bump the version number of
the unstable release by two.
</para>

<para>
The micro release number is reset to 0 when the minor release number is
incremented and then incremented with each version following until the
minor release number is modified again. Versions tagged between the
creation of a stable branch and the actual release -0 of this branch will
be identified by a micro release number of
<emphasis>pre<subscript>n</subscript></emphasis>, where
<emphasis>n</emphasis> is incremented each time a version is tagged.
</para>
