<title>VAT Support</title>
	
<para>
  You can turn an expense/income category into a VAT category, which means that
  it receives all the splits that actually make up the VAT payment towards the
  government. You can also enter a specific percentage rate.  entered.
</para>
 
<para>
  Categories can be assigned a VAT category, which allows KMyMoney to split a
  transaction for a category into two parts, one for the category and one for
  the VAT. Depending on the setting of the gross/net amount switch, the amount
  you enter for the transaction is the gross or net amount.
</para>
 
<para>
  Example: In Germany, there are three VAT percentages (0%, 7%, and 19%). So I
  have a main category "VAT paid" and three subcategories, one for each
  percentage rate. I create these on both the income and the expense sides so
  that I have eight categories in total.  For the goods I buy, I select one of
  the above mentioned categories as the "VAT category assignment".
</para>
 
<para>
  When I buy goods, I enter them into a transaction. Let's assume I have
  selected the gross amount entry method, once I enter the category and amount,
  KMyMoney will recognize that there's a VAT assignment and calculate the VAT
  part, create a second split with the VAT account and VAT amount and reduce the
  category amount.
</para>
 
<para>
  The same applies to income categories but the other way around. Hope that
  makes sense.

<title>Deleting categories</title>

<para>
  To delete a category, select it in the tree, right click to bring up the popup
  menu, and select <guimenuitem>Delete</guimenuitem>.  If there are any
  transactions assigned to this category, a popup will allow you to move these
  to another parent category. If you try to delete a parent category, a dialog
  allows the choice of either having the sub-categories moved up one level or
  alternatively having them all deleted at the same time.
