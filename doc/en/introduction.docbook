<title>What &kappname; is not</title>

<para>
As a personal finance manager, &kappname; is not intended to scale to the needs of an average business.  However, it would be possible to create client / supplier / document features through plugins.
</para>

<para>
&kappname; is not simply a clone of the commercially-available personal finance programs. Although many of the features present in &kappname; can be found in other similar applications, &kappname; strives to present an individual and unique view of your finances.
