<title>Institution Options</title>

<para>
  Right-clicking an institution name brings up an Institution Options sub-menu,
  providing you with several choices. Selecting <guimenuitem>New
  Institution...</guimenuitem> opens the New Institution Dialog, where you can
  enter all the necessary information to create a new institution.  Selecting
  <guimenuitem>Edit Institution...</guimenuitem> brings up an editable window
  with institution details such as name and address. Selecting
  <guimenuitem>Delete Institution</guimenuitem> removes the entire institution
  and all its associated accounts. Keep in mind that you will only be able to
  delete an institution if you can delete all of its accounts, and you will only
  be able to delete each associated account if it has no transactions and no
  schedules refers to it.  Selecting <guimenuitem>New account...</guimenuitem>
  steps you through the new account process, which is described in more detail
  in the next section.

    NOTE: You must have a file open before you can create a new institution. If
    you do not have an existing file, you will need to create a <link
    linkend="firsttime-3">new file</link>.

<para>

  optional.  As with the personal information dialog, this data is not currently
  used by &kappname;, but will be required by future releases for certain
  features.  In particular, the Routing Number and the <acronym><ulink

  Right-clicking an account name brings up an Account Options sub-menu.
  Selecting <guimenuitem>New account...</guimenuitem> steps you through the new

  your electronic entries. More details, as well as information about the other
