<title>GnuCash Importer</title>

<sect2>
<title>GnuCash Files</title>

<para>
  The &kappname; GnuCash importer handles direct reading of standard (&XML;)
  files as produced by GnuCash versions 1.8 and 2.0. The following are not
  supported:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem><para>import of database (Postgres) data</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>import of 'multi-book' files</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>import into an existing &kappname; file</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>import of small-business specific features (Employees,
    Invoices, etc.)</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>export to GnuCash files.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
  The import will probably only work correctly if presented with a valid
  file. It is recommended that the GnuCash 'Check &amp; Repair All' function (in
  the Actions menu) be run before attempting to import.
</para>

<para>
  Files can be opened by specifying the file name on the command line
  (<command>kmymoney &lt;filepath&gt;</command>), or by means of the &kappname;
  <menuchoice>
    <shortcut><keycombo><keysym>Ctrl-O</keysym></keycombo></shortcut>
    <guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem>
  </menuchoice> or
  <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem>
  </menuchoice> menu items.
</para>

<para>
  The similarity between the two products means that much day-to-day data can be
  imported in a straightforward fashion. However, there are some areas where
  differences arise, and various options are provided to deal with these. The
  following sections will describe some of these differences; understanding them
  should lead to a smoother importation.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Similarities, Differences, and Terminology</title>

<sect3>
<title>Small Business Usage</title>

<para>
  It should be noted that &kappname; is a <emphasis>personal</emphasis> finance
  manager, and as such, does not directly support any of the business features
  of GnuCash, such as tax tables, payroll, and tracking of lots. Any Accounts
  Payable or Receivable accounts found in a file will be imported as Liability
  or Asset accounts respectively.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Accounts</title>

<sect4>
<title>Account types</title>

<para>
  For both products, the highest level of structure in the file is the
  account. &kappname; supports 5 main types of account: Asset, Liability,
  Income, Expense and Equity, each of which may have various subtypes, e.g.,
  Checking, Credit Card, &etc;.  &kappname; includes a 'standard' account for
  each of these five types, and all other accounts are held subordinate to one
  of these. &kappname; enforces more consistency (or less flexibility, depending
  on your point of view) between account types than does GnuCash, and the
  importer will correct any inconsistencies it detects. This may result in a
  slightly different account structure, though this can, within reason, be
  amended after the import is complete.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>Categories</title>

<para>
  &kappname; uses the term Category to denote an account of an Income or Expense
  type. Unlike GnuCash, these are not considered as 'ledger' accounts, and entry
  of transactions folder into categories is not supported; allocations are made
  during transaction entry into other account types.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>Structure and Placeholders</title>

<para>
  GnuCash supports the use of Placeholder accounts. In effect, these are just
  read-only accounts into which no transactions can be entered, but which
  function in an analogous fashion to folders in a folder structure, as a
  holder for other accounts. Though &kappname; does not support this feature as
  such, it does provide a parent/child account relationship, so the importer
  simulates placeholders by creating empty accounts.

<sect3>
<title>Transactions and Splits</title>

<sect4>
<title>Balanced transactions</title>

<para>
  As with GnuCash, data is entered in the form of transactions, each generally
  consisting of 2 or more split entries. In fact, valid GnuCash transactions
  will always contain at least 2 splits, and to conform to GnuCash's
  double-entry bookkeeping standard, these must be in monetary balance (i.e.,
  they must balance out to zero). &kappname; encourages, but does not enforce,
  this standard, but any imported transaction which is not balanced will be
  marked in the ledger view as having a problem.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>Payees</title>

<para>
  &kappname; prefers that all transactions have a Payee (a generic term that
  encompasses both payees and payers), and unlike GnuCash, a list of these
  payees is maintained. Payee names are generated by the importer from the
  GnuCash transaction's Description field.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>Transfers</title>

<para>
  &kappname; uses the term Transfer to describe a transaction which does not
  involve a Category, but only transfers money between Asset and/or Liability
  accounts.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>Reconcile</title>

<para>
  &kappname; provides an account reconciliation function similar to that of
  GnuCash, and the corresponding transaction status will be imported.
</para>
</sect4>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Commodities</title>

<para>
  GnuCash uses the term Commodity to cover both currencies and non-currency
  assets. These are treated separately in &kappname;.
</para>

<sect4>
<title>Currencies</title>

<para>
  &kappname; has built-in support for all foreign 
  <link linkend="details.currencies">currency</link> types.  &kappname; also
  requires that the user specify a base currency, this being the default
  currency for new accounts. The importer will attempt to determine the most
  likely base currency, though this choice may be rejected in favour of an
  alternative.
</para>

<para>
  (NOTE: &kappname; does not currently support accounts denominated in 'defunct'
  currencies (except those replaced by the Euro). At present, it will be
  necessary to remove any such accounts from your GnuCash file before
  importing. We hope to improve on this situation in a future release.)
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4 id="gncsecurities">
<title>Securities and Investments</title>

<para>
  Non-currency assets (normally stocks and bonds) are called Securities by
  &kappname;, and represent the main difference between the two products, in
  that &kappname; requires any account denominated in a security to be
  subordinate to an Investment Account. This is described in more detail in the
  chapter on <link linkend="details.investments">Investments</link>. Though
  users may have implemented such a relationship, GnuCash imposes no defined
  structure on it, so the importer is unable to detect it and perform an
  automatic conversion. Three options are therefore made available:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>Create a separate Investment account for each security, with the same
    name as the security</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Create a single Investment account which will act as 'parent' for all
    security accounts</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Create several Investment accounts, and assign securities to them as
    directed by the user.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
  It depends entirely on user requirements which of these options is relevant in
  each situation, and in some cases, manual restructuring of accounts after
  importation may be necessary.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>Prices and currency rates</title>

<para>
  Security prices and currency exchange rates as displayed in the GnuCash Price
  Editor will be imported. In addition, price and rate entries will be generated
  from all transactions involving securities and multiple currencies.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4 id="details.impexp.gncquotes">
<title>Online Quotes</title>

<para>
  For obtaining online price and currency rate quotations, GnuCash uses a
  package called Finance::Quote. Recent versions of &kappname; contain support
  for this package for obtaining stock quotes, and this will be used by default
  when importing data.  You may however elect to convert to the native method
  used by &kappname; which is covered in more detail in
  <link linkend="details.investments.onlinequotes">online quotes</link>.
</para>

<para>
  If you choose to do so, the following dialog will allow selection of a
  'native' &kappname; price source, or a user-defined source, for each account
  for which online quotes are required. However, the stock (ticker) symbol will
  be imported unchanged. Since this symbol will almost certainly be different in
  the two packages, it will need to be manually edited after completion of the
  import process.  Future currency rate updates will not use Finance::Quote, and
  will always use the native retrieval method.

</para>
</sect4>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="gncschedules">
<title>Scheduled Transactions</title>

<para>
  &kappname; does not retain the separation made in GnuCash between template
  transactions and their frequency of occurrence. Transaction data will be
  duplicated if the same template is used in different schedules, but this is
  not likely to be of great significance.
</para>

<sect4>
<title>Schedule types</title>

<para>
  &kappname; classifies all schedules as one of three types, Bills, Deposits, or
  Transfers. Since GnuCash does not make such a distinction, the importer
  attempts to determine the classification from the accounts and direction of
  money movements. It may be that in some cases incorrect assumptions are made,
  and these will need manual correction.
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>Suspect Schedules</title>

<para>
  Some features of GnuCash scheduled transactions are not available in
  &kappname;, so the importer tries in each case to reach a reasonable
  compromise in converting the data. These transactions will be flagged as
  suspect, and the user will be given the option of editing them directly during
  the import process. Examples of situations which may cause this are:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>some frequency intervals supported in GnuCash are not currently
    available in &kappname;</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>&kappname; does not support the use of formulae and variables in
    amount fields</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>complex cases which have not yet been identified for import.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
  Despite best efforts, it is possible that, due to the many options involved, a
  scheduled transaction may cause a fatal error within &kappname;.  If this sort
  of problem seems to be occurring, the importer offers the option to drop all
  suspect schedules.
</para>
</sect4>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Reports</title>

<para>
  &kappname; provides a comprehensive selection of configurable reports,
  described in more detail in <link linkend="details.reports">Reports.</link>
  These will not necessarily, however, match precisely those reports available
  in GnuCash.

<title>Decoding Options</title>

<para>
  If your native language is written in letters or symbols which are different
  from those used in the 'Latin' languages (i.e., generally Western European),
  these are represented in a special fashion ('encoded') in your GnuCash file.
  If these letters are not displayed correctly on your screen, then they must be
  decoded.  Currently, it is often not possible to detect accurately which form
  of decoding must be used, so you may need to set this option and select an
  entry from the list.  In general, the first item in the list will be that
  which is considered appropriate for your locale (i.e., the country and
  language which was selected as native when your operating system was
  installed), so this should be tried first.  Since the import process does not
  overwrite your GnuCash file, you are free to experiment with any of these
  selections.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Transaction Notes option</title>

<para>
  Under some usage conditions, non-split GnuCash transactions may contain
  residual, often incorrect, memo data which is not normally visible to the
  user. When imported into &kappname; however, due to display differences, this
  data can become visible. Often, these transactions will have a Notes field
  describing the real purpose of the transaction. If this option is selected,
  these notes, if present, will be used to override the extraneous memo data.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Debug Options</title>

<para>
  These need only be used in the event of import problems.  If you have such
  problems, you should also report them to the &kappname; developer list
  &devlist;.  Note that the traces produced by these options may contain data of
  a confidential nature, and the Anonymize option should be used if they are to
  be made publicly available.
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Import Report</title>

<para>
  At the end of processing, the importer produces a report showing the number of
  different entities processed, and any errors or anomalies encountered. This
  report will be displayed on screen, and may be saved to a file for later
  review. A full report may contain the following sections:
</para>

<title>QIF Importer</title>

<sect2>
<title>QIF format considered harmful</title>

<para>
  Generally speaking, the QIF format should be avoided wherever possible.  It is
  a poor choice for transporting financial data.  Among other things, QIF suffers
  from these problems:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>Lack of standardized format: Different versions of the same program
    will impart different meanings to the same element.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Lack of transaction identifier: Because there is no ID number
    associated with each transaction, matching duplicate transactions is
    haphazard at best.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Lack of expressiveness: The grammar is really simple, and cannot
    portray the depth of financial information found in today's financial
    environment.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
  This is generally why Intuit stopped supporting QIF input at all with Quicken
  2005.  If you have the option of getting data some other way, like OFX, always
  choose that option.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>How to import a QIF file</title>

<para>
  To import a QIF file, first ensure you have a valid &kappname; file open.
  Then select <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem> <guimenuitem>QIF</guimenuitem>
  from the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu.

</para>

<para>
  The resulting dialog prompts for the QIF filename allowing you to locate the
  file by clicking on the <guibutton>Browse</guibutton> button.
</para>

<para>
  Also, &kappname; differentiates between the import of a bank statement file
  and historic data exported from another application. The default is to import
  a bank statement file. In case you are importing data from your previous personal
  finance manager application select the appropriate option.
</para>

<para>
  In general the default QIF profile should work with your QIF data. In some
  cases it might become necessary to use a modified QIF profile. See
  the <link linkend="details.impexp.qifimp.profile">next section</link> for more
  details on that subject.
</para>

<para>
  Click on <guibutton>Import</guibutton> to import the QIF file.
</para>

<para>
  &kappname; will start scanning the file to determine the formats used to
  represent dates and numbers. In case it cannot determine a date format
  unambiguously, &kappname; will ask the user to select one from the list of
  possible date formats.
</para>

<para>
  Next, &kappname; imports the data and creates all necessary objects, such as
  payee information, accounts and category records, and stock price information.
  Wherever possible, existing transactions will be matched against the imported
  information. A progress bar is shown and updated during the import process.
</para>

<para>
  In case &kappname; could not detect the name of the account to be imported,
  the user will be asked to select the account into which the data should be
  imported. If the account does not already exist in your file, a new account
  can be created by clicking on <guibutton>Create</guibutton>.
</para>

<para>
  At the end of the import, &kappname; shows a statement import statistics
  window.
</para>

<para>

</para>

<para>
  After importing, all of the imported transactions will be shown with a yellow
  background in the ledger view.  In case &kappname; was able to match an
  imported transaction with an already existing transaction, the background is
  shown in light green.
</para>

<para>
  The next step is to verify the imported data and accept it. This is a general
  process and also applies to imports from other sources. It is outlined in a
  separate section of this document.

<title>Setting up a QIF profile</title>

</note>
<!--
<para>
	The most commonly changed thing between QIF implementations is the date format.  
	So if this is the first time you're importing a QIF file, spend a few moments to figure out what format the dates are in, and set the QIF Profile accordingly.

</sect2>

<sect2><title>Apostrophe format</title>

<para>
	Many common QIF writers use a 2-digit representation for the year. 
	This is ambiguous, because the importer cannot know which century the date belongs in.
	To make things even more complicated, QIF files will often used an apostrophe as a year separator to indicate that the date belongs in the OTHER century from the default.
</para>
<para>
	For example, if the default century is 1900-1999, the date 12/31/95 would mean 1995.  The date 12/31'05 would mean 2005.
</para>
<para>
	Because the QIF format is not standardized, it's impossible to know which century is desired.
	This is why you have to explicitly state it in the QIF profile.
	You do this by specifying which century is intended when an apostrophe is found.
	In the example above, you would set the Apostrophe Format to &quot;2000-2099&quot;, so dates with an apostrophe will be interpreted as being &gt; year 2000.
	In this case, dates without an apostrophe will be treated as being in the 1900's.
</para>
-->
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Transaction matching</title>

<para>
  As noted previously, one of the major drawbacks of the QIF format is the lack
  of a unique identifier for each transaction.  Thus, if you import a QIF file
  and some of the transactions are already in your ledger, you may get
  duplicates.  &kappname; attempts to get around this by looking for
  transactions that look similar to those you already have.  If it finds
  something that looks like the same transaction, it will match the apparent
  duplicate.
</para>

<para>
  This can be a problem if you have transactions that look too similar but are
  actually different.  In this case, you can unmatch those transactions later in
  the ledger view.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>Writing an import filter</title>

<para>
  Sometimes you may have data in a custom format, like comma-separated-values
  (CSV), or something else unique to your situation.  You can still import that
  file into &kappname; using a QIF Import Filter.  A filter is a custom program
  you write which takes your special file as input, and produces a QIF file as
  output.  This can be a shell script, a perl script, a compiled program written
  in C/C++, or anything else you can dream of, as long as the system can run it.
</para>

<para>
  To use it, edit your favorite QIF Profile, and select the Filter tab.  Enter
  the location of your filter program where prompted.  Then, whenever you do a
  QIF import using this profile, the file you select for importing will be run
  through your filter first.
</para>

<para>
  A common problem is to convert a list of comma-separated-values into a QIF
  file.  This is a textbook case for the awk tool.  Create a script called
  csv2qif.awk, with the following two lines as contents:
</para>

<programlisting>
	BEGIN { FS=&quot;,&quot;; print &quot;!Type:Bank&quot; }

	{ print &quot;D&quot;$1; print &quot;T&quot;$2; print &quot;N&quot;$3; print &quot;P&quot;$4; print &quot;M&quot;$5; print &quot;^&quot; }
</programlisting>

<para>
  Then, change the QIF keys (D,T,N,P,M) to match the order of your csv data.
  Set the input filter to <userinput>awk -f csv2qif.awk</userinput>.
</para>

<para>
  Another problem sometimes arises in the encoding of QIF files.  &kappname;
  expects files to be UTF8 encoded.  If your file is encoded in something else,
  it can be useful to convert it to UTF8.  For example to convert it from
  iso-8859-1, you would set the input filter to <userinput>recode
  iso-8859-1..utf-8</userinput>.
</para>

</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Special &kappname; QIF extensions</title>

<para>
  As already mentioned, one of the major drawbacks of the QIF format is the lack
  of a unique identifier for each transaction.  If you are writing your own QIF
  file creator (or filter, as described above), you can overcome this problem.
  &kappname; supports the '#' field.  The importer will interpret this as a
  unique transaction ID, and disregard the record if the transaction is already
  in the system.

<title>OFX Importer Plugin</title>

<sect2>
<title>Getting the plugin</title>

<para>
  &kappname; will import OFX files painlessly.  However, this functionality is
  not built into the core program.  You must obtain and install the OFX Importer
  Plugin.  Once that is installed, the command to import OFX files will
  automatically show up under the <quote>File | Import</quote> menu.
</para>
<para>
  Note that many prepackaged versions of &kappname; were built with the OFX
  importer already included or available as a separate package.  If the OFX
  importer does not seem to be installed in your version, the first place to
  check is in the same place you got your base &kappname; package.
</para>
<para>
  If you have installed from RPM, the OFX Importer Plugin is contained within
  the kmymoney-ofx RPM.  It should be available from whatever source you got the
  base &kappname; RPM.  If you have built from sources, all you need to do is
  have preferrably the libOFX 0.9 development headers and libraries installed
  on your system.  The &kappname; build process will detect these and compile
  the plugin.  libOFX 0.8.2 is supported as well, but some features are not
  supported with this version of the library.
</para>
<para>
  Should you run into trouble trying to compile &kappname;, and you are certain
  you have the correct version of libOFX installed, please contact the
  developers list &devlist; for assistance.  Include a copy of your config.log
  file, compressed first via gzip.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Importing an OFX file</title>

<para>
  The most basic way to import an OFX file is to choose the importer from the
  menu bar.  From the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu,
  choose <guimenuitem>Import</guimenuitem>, and
  then <guimenuitem>OFX</guimenuitem>.  If OFX does not show up under Import,
  you do not have the OFX Importer Plugin installed correctly.  Please see the
  previous section.
</para>

<para>
  The first thing the importer will do is ask you into which account to import
  the transactions.  If there are transactions from multiple accounts in your
  file, you will be asked this question multiple times.
</para>

<para>
  After importing, some of your transactions may be shown with an exclamation
  mark on a yellow triangle in the ledger.  This is because they need to be
  assigned a category.  The importer was not able to automatically assign a
  category based on your past transaction history.  You can edit each
  transaction in the ledger to assign a category, and the mark will be removed.
</para>

<para>
  Please note that this section describes the <quote>native</quote> OFX
  importer.  OFX files may also be imported using the AqBanking Importer Plugin
  if you have installed that.  Note that the two importers do behave slightly
  differently, and they are written and supported by two different developers.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Importing Investments</title>

<para>
  Please note that if you are importing a file with investment transactions,
  those investments must first exist in your &kappname; file.  The trading
  symbol is used to match, so please ensure that the symbol in &kappname; is
  exactly the same as the one in the file you're importing.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="details.impexp.webconnect">
<title>Web Connect</title>

<para>
  The easiest way to import an OFX file is to set up Web Connect.  Visit your
  bank's web site, and click on a link to download an OFX file.  Your browser
  should ask you what program you would like to use to open the program.  Point
  your browser to &kappname;.  It will then import the downloaded OFX file into
  the &kappname; file you most recently had open.  You can also change the file
  associations of your desktop environment, and have &kappname; open the OFX
  file automatically for you.
</para>

<para>
  If you need to import the OFX file into some other &kappname; file, load up
  that file in &kappname; first, and then visit your bank's web site.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="details.impexp.ofxdirectconnect">
<title>Direct Connect</title>

<para>
  OFX Direct Connect is now supported in &kappname;.  This gives you the ability
  to contact your bank directly to obtain statements.  In the future, there will
  be more help written, and this will be moved to its own section.
</para>

<para>
  To enable this feature, you must compile &kappname; with the
  --enable-ofxbanking switch (now the default).
</para>

<para>
  Please be warned: Many banks require a separate signup, will give you a
  separate password or PIN, and may even charge you a separate fee for this
  service.  No bank directly supports &kappname;.  You will have to tell them
  you want to bank directly from MS Money or Quicken.
</para>

<para>
  The first step is to configure each account for which you wish to download
  statements. Go to the Accounts view, right click on the account you wish to
  configure, and choose <quote>Map to online account...</quote>. In case more
  than one online banking plugin is installed on your system you will be asked
  which one to use. For the internal OFX method select KMyMoney OFX.  A list of
  banks will be downloaded from the Internet and a wizard will guide you through
  choosing a bank, entering your username and password, and selecting an
  account.  Should you find that your bank is not listed, then it may still be
  possible to use the manual option. Your bank may be able to provide the
  required parameters, or you may have to do some research to find them.
</para>

<para>
  Once you have an account set up with online banking, go to the ledger for that
  account.  Then from the <quote>Account</quote> menu, choose <quote>Update
  account...</quote>.  This will connect to your bank, and download a statement
  for the last 60 days.
