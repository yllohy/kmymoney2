  * QIF Importer improvements for investments
    - Fixed reversed sign on dividend importing
    - Fixed price importing.  Previously, it only imported prices for the
      current account.  But really it should import them for any prices you have
      in your KMM file.
    - Added line number to warnings, to make it easier to track them down
    - Converted many dialog-box warnings to debug output.  They weren't that 
      useful in dialogs
    - Removed "QIF/" from bank ID's.  It was a bad design decision to include
      that.  If you import the same transaction 2 different ways, it will
      seem different to KMM, but it should look like the same transaction.
    - Warn when importing an investment transaction without a stock

  * Fix QIF import to set shares as well as value.  This bug caused reports to
    be all 0's until the file was saved and reloaded.  The reload ran it
    through KMMView::fixTransactions(), which fixed the problem.

    importer will refuse to load a transaction which contains the same
    transaction ID as an existing transaction.
  * Separated --enable-ofx into --enable-ofxplugin and --enable-ofxbanking.
    ofxplugin enables ofx support only in the plugin.  It defualts ON, and
    should be left on for the release.  ofxbanking enables OFX direct 
    connect, and causes the main application to require libofx.  This 
    is experimental and is not desired for production use.
