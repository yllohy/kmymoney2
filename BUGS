You cannot create transactions with an amount 0.01  They get created as
having a zero balance!  It's the same for -0.01 as well.  0.02 seems to
work fine.

When you have a transaction with an amount >= 1 million and you try to
edit it the editor shows the number as 1,000,000.00 but if you click
enter the last three digits are lost.  Affects US & UK currencies haven't
checked the others.

Random crashes on exit ?

Payee list doesn't get cleared on close.

Start dialog should not show files that don't exist.

Autocomplete should not put the last amount in deposit when entering a
withdrawal.  (Does it do the same the other way around).  (Last transaction
using the payee was a deposit).

Use kMyMoneyEdit instead of line edit to better parse number input in the
transaction view.

Better user feedback in kmymoney2 e.g using status bar messages and the like.
