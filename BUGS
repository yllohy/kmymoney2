You cannot create transactions with an amount 0.01  They get created as
having a zero balance!  It's the same for -0.01 as well.  0.02 seems to
work fine.

When you have a transaction with an amount >= 1 million and you try to
edit it the editor shows the number as 1,000,000.00 but if you click
enter the last three digits are lost.  Affects US & UK currencies haven't
checked the others.

Random crashes on exit ?
