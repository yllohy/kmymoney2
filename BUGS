You cannot create transactions with an amount 0.01  They get created as
having a zero balance!  It's the same for -0.01 as well.  0.02 seems to
work fine.

Random crashes on exit ?

Autocomplete should not put the last amount in deposit when entering a
withdrawal.  (Does it do the same the other way around).  (Last transaction
using the payee was a deposit).

Better user feedback in kmymoney2 e.g using status bar messages and the like.
