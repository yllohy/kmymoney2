KMyMoney  (covered by the GNU license - see COPYING)

If you need some more information, please make sure to visit the projects
homepage at http://kmymoney2.sourceforge.net/  A lot of information is
found there.

KMyMoney is a true KDE application and therefor requires the KDE as well as
QT libraries. If you want to compile the application yourself, you have to
make sure to have the development relevant parts (include files, link
libraries) of these two projects.  KMyMoney is based on min QT 3.2
and KDE 3.2

---------------------------------
Prior to installation
---------------------------------

To compile, you will need the development headers for KDE libs and all additional
you install (libofx, aqbanking, etc)
Also, you will need the compile tools. This includes make and gcc

Example for K/Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install kdelibs4-dev build-essential

---------------------------------
Compiling and installing KMyMoney
---------------------------------

1a)  If you got the sources from CVS you will need to type:

        make -f Makefile.dist

     before you proceed. If you installed from a source tar-ball, you
     don't have to run this command.

1b)  If you got the sources from a tar-ball you will need to type:

        tar -xvjf kmymoney2-[version].tar.bz2    or
        tar -xvzf kmymoney2-[version].tar.gz

     depending if the packages was made with bzip2 or gzip compression.
     Change into the directory with

        cd kmymoney2-[version]


The following steps have to be performed no matter where you got the source
from.

2)   Run configure to tell the project about your local environment

           ./configure --with-qt-dir=[your location of qt3] \
                       --prefix=[your location of kde3]

     Debian/Ubuntu/Kubuntu/... users have to prepend the call to
     configure with a variable setting to be able to view the online
     manual from within the application. If you have such a system,
     please use the following command syntax:

           kde_htmldir=/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML ./configure ---with....

     Below, please find a table of values for the above for several
     distributions:

     Distribution      | --with-qt-dir           | --prefix
     ------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------
     SuSE >= 8.1       |  omit this parameter    | ommit this parameter
     Mandrake 9.0      |  omit this parameter    | /usr
     Slackware >= 9.0  |  omit this parameter    | /opt/kde
     MEPIS             |  omit this parameter    | /usr
     RedHat 8/9        |  omit this parameter    | /usr
     Fedora 1/2	       |  omit this parameter    | /usr
     Mandriva 2006     |  omit this parameter    | /usr
     Debian            |  omit this parameter    | omit this parameter
     K/X/Ubuntu        |  omit this parameter    | omit this parameter 

     so for SuSE 9.1 the command is:

           ./configure --mandir=/usr/share/man 

      and for Debian/Ubuntu the command is:

           kde_htmldir=/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML ./configure

     Please tell us the values for other distributions, so we can add
     them to this list. Send an e-mail to the developers mailing list.
     See the address below.

3)   Build the package by issuing the following command:

          make

4)   Gain root permissions to install the application

     Type the command

           su

     and provide the necessary password to become 'root'.

     (You can skip this step and step 6 if your distribution uses sudo, and just prefix 
      sudo the command in the next step. eg, sudo make install)

5)   Install the application

     Run the command

           make install

     to populate the directories in the KDE directory tree.

6)   Revert to normal user

     Type

           exit

     to become the normal user again. This concludes the installation
     process of KMyMoney.
