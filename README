The two most important libraries are QT-3.0.* and above available from www.trolltech.com and
KDE 3 from www.kde.org.  At least version 3.0 of KDE is required to run KMyMoney2.

To compile use this general sequence:

  tar --bzip2 -xvf kmymoney2-0.5.[version].tar.bz2
  cd kmymoney-0.5.[version]
  ./configure --with-qt-dir=[your location of qt3] --prefix=[your location of kde3]
  su # to gain root permissions to install
  make install
  exit # to revert to normal user

  If you got the sources from CVS you will need to type:
    make -f Makefile.dist
  before running configure.

  Please read INSTALL for generic instructions on how to use configure.
