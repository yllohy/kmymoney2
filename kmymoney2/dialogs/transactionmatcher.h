   * This method matches the manual entered transaction @p tm with the imported
   * transaction @p ti based on the splits @p sm and @p si. If the match can be applied,
   * MyMoneyTransaction::addMatch() is used to include @p ti inside @p tm and the
   * engine data (MyMoneyFile) is updated. A possible bankid found in the imported
   * split is carried over into the manual transaction.
   *
   * The following things will be done in case of a match:
   *
   * - if the postdate differs between the two transactions
   *   - the postdate of the manual entered transaction is stored in kmm-orig-postdate
   *   - the postdate of the imported transaction is assigned to the resulting transaction
   * - if the payee differs between the two splits
   *   - the payee of the manual split is stored in kmm-orig-payee
   *   - the payee of the imported split is assigned to the resulting split
   * - if the reconciliation state is not-reconciled
   *   - the reconciliation state is set to cleared
   * - the bankid of the imported transaction is assigned to the resulting transaction
   * - the resulting transaction will be updated and the imported transaction removed
   *   from the engine
   *
   * The application of the match depends on the following items:
   *
   * - both share values of @p sm and @p si must be identical
   * - @p tm must be a non-imported (see below), non-matched transaction
   * - @p ti must be an imported transaction
   *
   * If @p allowImportedTransactions is true, @p tm may be an imported transaction. The
   * default of @p allowImportedTransactions is @p false.
   *
   * In case of errors, an exception is thrown.

   *
   * - the enclosed imported transaction is extracted and restored
   * - if the kvp contains a kmm-orig-payee record
