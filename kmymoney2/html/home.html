or have any other talents you want to contribute to this application, please
feel free to contact us using the the developers mailing list

<b>Warning: Since this version of KMyMoney2 only writes data files in it's new
format, files written with this version cannot be read by old versions of the
stable branch (e.g. 0.4 and prior). If
you still want to use these versions of KMyMoney2 with your data files,
please make sure you keep a backup-file of your finance data.
 Unfortunately, there's no way back.</b>
