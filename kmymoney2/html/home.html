or have any other talents you want to contribute to this application, please

<b>Warning: Since this version of KMyMoney2 only writes data files in it's new
format, files written with this version cannot be read by old versions. If
you still want to use prior versions of KMyMoney2 with your data files,
please make sure you keep a backup-file of your finance data.
 Unfortunately, there's no way back.</b>
